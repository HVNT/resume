            The past few years, while I have been pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I have been working at
            various startups - from consulting to co-founding. Today, I work at a marketing automation company called
            Landing Lion that I co-founded with a team made up of primarily Georgia Tech graduates.

            I currently have a strong passion in data info-visualizations and analytics.
            I strive to allow people to look at data and analytical information in new, creative, and complex ways which
            have yet to be discovered.

            I value hard work, am dedicated to my role contributing to a better business society, and find joy in my ability to
            incorporate computer science applications into the lives of many.
