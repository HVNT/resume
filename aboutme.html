        <p class="date marginAME">A short story about me.</p>

        <p class="marginAME">To make a long story short, I came to Georgia Tech without ever even seeing a line of code
            as an Industrial Engineering major. Sophomore
            summer I took my first Computer Science class, it was some intro Python class and instantly fell in love. I
            ended up interning that fall with a consulting company
            that focused on supply chain stuff, but I felt like I was just going through the motions - doing the
            internship just to add a line to my resume. I came to the
            realization I don't have to live my life this way.
            <br>
            <br>
            After that semester I officially switched my major to Computer Science, that was Spring 2012. So officially,
            I've been programming for about a year now, and
            I've literally loved every second. I have a very curious mind and love constantly challenging myself. Hence
            my extreme passion for Computer Science. I chase
            that eureka feeling you get after a tough concept finally clicks. I don't see myself losing this passion
            anytime soon.
            <br>
            <br>
            My passion for Computer Science is no hoax. I truly want to work for a company that will challenge me daily.
            If you take a look at my resume, note what I have been able to accomplish and learn in only a year of
            programming. I can't wait to look back a year
            from now and see how far I've come again. It's been an amazing ride so far, and I can't wait to see where it
            takes me.

        <p class="date marginAME">Update on me. (1 year later)</p>

        <p class="marginAME">
            Last summer (2014) I was fortunate enough to find like-minded souls in Atlanta. Since then we have moved in
            together and co founded our newest
            venture Reverb.IO. We are all three full stack developers and together we are able to build very cool end-to-end
            web applications. We finally got a little break from all the work we've had piling up and threw up a quick landing
            page for reverb.
            <br>
            <br>
            Go check it out at <a class="java-the-hut" href="http://www.reverb.io">reverb.io</a>
        </p>

        <p class="date marginAME">Update on me. (6 months later)</p>

        <p class="marginAME">
            Reverb.io has grown to four members. Alan's dad Phil joined the team. He's a DB expert who has a ton of experience
            in MSFT SQL. We have been working in "stealth mode" on a project called Landing Lion (LL) for the past 6 months (since Feb 1, 2015).
            Landing Lion is a marketing scalable landing page solution that also offers deep analytics on your landing page traffic.
            We are about to go into closed beta to test our first iteration. Hopefully people like what we've built.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'll post a link when we decide to post more public info on LL.
