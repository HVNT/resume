    <p class="date marginAME">A short story about me.</p>
    <p class="marginAME">To make a long story short, I came to Georgia Tech without ever even seeing a line of code as an Industrial Engineering major. Sophomore
        summer I took my first Computer Science class, it was some intro Python class and instantly fell in love. I ended up interning that fall with a consulting company
        that focused on supply chain stuff, but I felt like I was just going through the motions - doing the internship just to add a line to my resume. I came to the
        realization I don't have to live my life this way.
        <br>
        <br>
        After that semester I officially switched my major to Computer Science, that was Spring 2012. So officially, I've been programming for about a year now, and
        I've literally loved every second. I have a very curious mind and love constantly challenging myself. Hence my extreme passion for Computer Science. I chase
        that eureka feeling you get after a tough concept finally clicks. I don't see myself losing this passion anytime soon.
        <br>
        <br>
        My passion for Computer Science is no hoax. I truly want to work for a company that will challenge me daily.
        If you take a look at my resume, note what I have been able to accomplish and learn in only a year of programming. I can't wait to look back a year
        from now and see how far I've come again. It's been an amazing ride so far, and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
