This is my personal site to host my resume and some stuff about me. I might occasionally put random stuff on their and I pretty frequently change the design to keep up with current trends. It's really just for kicks and gigs and a result of me being to lazy to deal with the frustrations of Microsoft Word to format a resume. I bootstrapped some CSS, none of it is used at the moment but I anticipate I might in the future if I add a blog or some shit. Feel free to steal anything and use it for your own resume site. Have fun bros.
